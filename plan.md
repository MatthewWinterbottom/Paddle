# Plan to Build a Real-Time Paddle Game

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React (with TypeScript)
- **Game Engine**: `PixiJS` or `Phaser` for 2D graphics and game logic
- **State Management**: React Context or Zustand
- **Communication**: WebSockets via `Socket.IO`

### Backend

- **Language**: Node.js (with TypeScript)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Real-Time Communication**: `Socket.IO`
- **Database**: Redis (optional, for session storage or game states)
- **Hosting**: AWS, Vercel, or Render

### Deployment

- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify
- **Backend Hosting**: Render or AWS Lambda
- **Domain Management**: Cloudflare

## Plan

### 1. Game Design

- Two paddles and a ball in a game canvas.
- Players control paddles with keyboard inputs (`W/S` or `Up/Down` keys).
- Objective: Prevent the ball from passing your paddle and score against the opponent.

---

### 2. Frontend

1. **Setup**

   - Create a Next.js app with TypeScript.
   - Install `pixi.js` or `phaser`.

2. **Game UI**

   - Full-screen canvas for the game.
   - Render paddles, ball, and boundaries.
   - Smooth animations with animation frames.

3. **Player Input**

   - Capture keyboard events for paddle movement.

4. **WebSocket Integration**
   - Establish `Socket.IO` connection.
   - Emit paddle movements and listen for updates (ball position, opponent paddle).

---

### 3. Backend

1. **WebSocket Server**

   - Use `Socket.IO` for real-time communication.
   - Create rooms for two-player games.
   - Sync paddle and ball positions.

2. **Game Logic**

   - Calculate ball trajectory and detect collisions.
   - Broadcast updated game state to players.

3. **Matchmaking**
   - Implement pairing of players into game rooms.

---

### 4. Deployment

1. **Frontend**

   - Deploy on Vercel or Netlify.

2. **Backend**

   - Deploy on Render, AWS, or similar platform.

3. **Domain Setup**
   - Use Cloudflare for a custom domain and SSL.

---

### 5. Optional Features

- Scoring system and timer.
- Chat feature in the game room.
- Multiple games with unique URLs or rooms.
- Leaderboard using Redis or a database.

### 6. Timeline

| **Day** | **Task**                               |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Day 1   | Set up frontend and backend.           |
| Day 2   | Render canvas and basic game elements. |
| Day 3   | Implement WebSocket communication.     |
| Day 4   | Add ball physics and scoring logic.    |
| Day 5   | Test the game and deploy.              |
